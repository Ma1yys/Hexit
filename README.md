# **Hex editor in python**

I made a hex editor in python!
You can try it out but you have to get these packages:
```CMD
pip install customtkinter==0.3
pip install setuptools
```

## **Starting up**
When starting the program up after instaling those packages you just double click on the file and it should start up.

## **Something wrong?**
If it doesn't spin up try this:
```CMD2
pip install --upgrade customtkinter
```
If that doesn't work, open an issue and let me know what happend!

## **Executables**
You can now download only the program with modules embeded in it. (Open an issue if not working)

## **Linux support**
You have to install these like on windows:
```BASH
pip install customtkinter==0.3
pip install setuptools
```
It should work because it works on replit.com

(Release only for Windows for now. When i have time i will make a release for Linux)
