# **Hex editor in python**

I made a hex editor in python!
You can try it out but you have to get these packages:
```CMD
pip install customtkinter==0.3
pip install setuptools
```

## **Starting up**
When starting the program up after instaling those packages you just double click on the file and it should start up.

### **Something wrong?**
Open an issue and let me know!
